# odin-landing-page

A basic landing page, done as part of the Odin project curriculum. To be honest, I don't love putting container divs around content within sections, but to match the spec document, it seemed the easiest way, at least until subgrid becomes a commonly available thing (which, as of the initial commit in early 2022, it still isn't yet). 

I tweaked the colors a little, to fit them better into the HSL scheme; also, I tried to make things somewhat responsive, especially the text sizes. That necessitated a fair number of media queries to get right. Finally, I couldn't help using a little bit of grid for the card layout, though I know in the Odin Project sequence, that's a little premature...
